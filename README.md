ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to fetch stock market data using Yahoo Finance API (yfinance), preprocess it with scaling, and train a machine learning model to predict stock prices.

ðŸš€ Features

Fetch stock data from any market (NSE, BSE, NASDAQ, NYSE, LSE, Crypto, etc.) using yfinance.

Preprocess data with train-test split and scaling (avoiding data leakage).

Build and train ML models for stock price prediction.

Evaluate model performance on test data.

Ready-to-use Jupyter Notebook (stock_price_prediction.ipynb).
